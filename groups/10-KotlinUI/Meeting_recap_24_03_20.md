# IAS Gruppe 10 - KotlinUI
# Recap of the meeting on the 24.03.20

Paricipants: Christian Tshudin, Christopher Schreb, Nour Hany, Sanja Popovic, Travis Rivera Petit

We ...

* Decided to expand on the existing Bachelorarbeit of Cedrik Schimshar since implementing everything from scratch would not be realistic.

* Defined the goals of the project:
  * __Onboarding without internet:__ There are alternatives to using pubs for onboarding: a user should have the possibility to connect to their first friend by using bluetooth, sound or QR-Code to exchange IDâ€˜s. We came to the conclusion that we should leave this part for last because it depends on the work of other groups.
  * __Update the log format:__ implement a binary log format instead of the current ASII JSON implementation.
  * __Interchange data:__

* Asked Chritopher to facilitate us getting an Android phone for Sanja
  * He will get in touch with Heiko Schuldt (?) because his research team may have some to spare (?)
  * otherwise they can be bought in Amazon for ~ 60 Euros.

* Established TODOS for each member for that week
  * install Androd Studio and set up Cerdrik's app.
  * read Cedrik's thesis and get a bit familiar with the code
  * define the responsiblity of each member
