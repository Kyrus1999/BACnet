# SoundLink Meeting Notes

## 13.04.2020

Attendees:
* Caroline Steiblin
* Renato Farruggio

Goal:
* Go through updated documentation & plan for update

Comments:
* Android Studio implementation runs without error, but sending/receieving on different frequencies, so not yet functional
* Need compatibility to Android Surf City?
* Created a git repo for code - https://github.com/RenatoFarruggio/quietmodem

## 12.04.2020

Attendees:
* Caroline Steiblin
* Renato Farruggio

Goal:
* Expectations for status presentation
* Set plan for implementation

ToDos:
* Update ReadMe to outline our outputs and clearly define what we are doing for other groups
* Plan out collaboration with other groups
* Solve errors in Android Studio

Comments:
* Current plan: Android implementation of Quiet
* Will need to build mini transport layer
* If idea for Android Studio implementation does not work, then revert to extending old project - for this let's wait and discuss with the TAs

Next Steps:
* Follow-up call on 13.04.to go over update

## 23.03.2020

Attendees:
* Caroline Steiblin
* Renato Farruggio
* Prof. Tschudin

Goal: 
* Short distance communication via sound from phone to phone
* Letters and numbers over frequency or tone (0-9, a-z, punctuation), around 50 characters to encode
* Link to other group - Kotlin group to write us an app?
* Overview of other projects (how could we extend it?)

Previous projects:
* Try to extend to Android - Quiet already has some functionality here

Coordination with other groups:
* Compatibility with 4 (Nikodem, Guni, Joey), 12 (Alexander Oxley, Carlos Tejera, Pascal Kunz)
* Be compatible with 5,6,8,9
* Kotlin - 10 (Sanja, Nour, Travis)

Requirements:
* TBD
* Continuous documentation of actions
* See in April with the midterm evaluation
* Create something functional for integration

Comments:
* Packet size limitations - check technology allowances
* Need to build mini stack to check functionality for tests - mini transport layer
* Avoid IP
* Smartphone aspect interesting
* With ideas contact Carlos (TA) and/or Prof. Tschudin
* Can we go further than previous groups' work - longer distance than just 5cm?

Next Steps:
* Android functionality - research this (before contacting Kotlin group) / prototype
* Read through past project & see if we can extend
