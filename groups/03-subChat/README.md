## UI

Since The creation of a User Interface is our the main objective, it's intuitiveness is of critical importance to us

## Prototype Structure
The following image explains, how the code is structured
![image](Grafiken/Datenbank.jpeg)
The Prototype is making use of the demo files (BACnet/src/demo/lib). They have been modified to take inputs from methods (instead of the command line as they were indended to).

### Wireframes

* different Wireframes are being made an tested by friends and family to make sure we come up with an intuitive design

## Language

We've decided build our User Interface with Python's TkInter

## Protocols

Protocols from meeting can be found [here](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/BACnet/tree/master/groups/03-subChat/Protocols).

### To-Do's

### nice-to-know
how to use the demo files to create entries:

> ./crypto.py >alice.key
> ./feed.py --keyfile alice.key alice.pcap create
> 	["write entries like this!"]
> ./feed.py alice.pcap dump
> 
> 
> ./feed.py --keyfile alice.key alice.pcap append
> 	['write entries like this!']
