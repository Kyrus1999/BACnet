### Details
The group logMerge, consisting of our members Nikodem, Joey and GÃ¼nes, aims to provide a service that can be used to keep some files in sync. By using our project, bandwidth can be saved by reducing the packets that have to be sent.
With time passing by, our group decided to split the project in two halves, our EventCreationTool and our main project logMerge. 

### EventCreationTool: 

Our group developed an EventCreationTool for other groups to be used. With this tool, other groups can create BACNet feeds and events much easier. To get a more detailed view on how things work with our tool, visit: https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/BACnet/blob/master/groups/04-logMerge/eventCreationTool/README.md

### LogMerge:

As for our main project,  we will store and receive data from the database for various groups in this project. To get a more detailed look on how things work, visit: https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/BACnet/blob/master/groups/04-logMerge/logMerge/README.md
