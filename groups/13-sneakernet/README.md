# Group 13: sneakernet

## Members:
Leonhard Badenberg, Patrik BÃ¼tler, Luka Obser

## Goal:
To implement a sneakernet that enables offline updates to and from the BACnet.

## Product:
You can find our final version in the [code folder](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/BACnet/tree/master/groups/13-sneakernet/code).
To use our service you need to install the [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [LogMerge](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/BACnet/blob/master/groups/04-logMerge/logMerge/README.md) packages.
To run the software execute `guiSneakernet.py` in the directory with the database that locally represents the BACnet.  


A demonstration of our product can be found [here](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/BACnet/tree/master/groups/Demo_D).

Please note that our product has not been prepared for deployment. The import statements might need some minor adjustments so be wary.

## Documentation:
Presentations, reports and meeting protocols are archived in the [docs folder](https://github.com/cn-uofbasel/BACnet/tree/master/groups/13-sneakernet/docs).

DISCLAIMER! Other than the final report the documents (especially the scope statement) should not be considered accurate specifications of our final version.
They rather serve as a documentation of the development process.
