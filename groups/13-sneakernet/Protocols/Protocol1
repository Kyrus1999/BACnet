####Clarification of the project's goals and concept:
After presenting our ideas and visions of the to be implemented sneakernet we received feedback and were able to formulate some general use-cases which will be specified further in a seperate document.

####Discussion of possible reference material and connections to other projects:
Prof. Tschudin mentioned a similar project he led at a regional high school previously and will send us its results, as well as data we can use to simulate a network for testing purposes.

Group 1's  project shares similarities to ours as it strives to implement a way of syncing two users' databases.

Group 4's project revolves around efficiently updating the local representation of the BACnet which will be one of the main challenges of our service which is limited by bandwidth and storage.

###Preperation for the next orderly meeting with Prof. Tschudin in mid april:
* Specify use-cases for our service
* Create a mockup (and ideally a prototype) of the software accompanying the sneakernet
* Contact groups 1 and 4 to discuss shared problems and goals
