## Database

* Based on [mySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)

## Interfaces

To supply the service of a well working database to either applications or to the groups 4 and 12, we have to define well working as well as well serving interfaces. Those will be defined shortly and documented in this part.

## Algorithms

The database will have to perform certain actions which will involve algorithms. For example [topological sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) or [similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Database_algorithms) algorithms will be used. 

## Coordination

To furthermore integrate the database correctlty into the BACnet, a lot of coordination and communication will be needed. First meetings with group 4 and 12 will happen in week 12. 

Results will be published here.

## Protocols

Protocols from meeting can be found [here]().

## Glossary

Will be filled shortly.

## Links

Will be filled shortly.
